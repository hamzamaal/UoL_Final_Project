            <h2>Ensuring Food Safety</h2>
            <p>
                At Food Connector, we prioritize the safety of the food we help redistribute. 
                Whether you are a donor or a recipient, understanding and following proper food safety guidelines is essential.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Food Safety Matters</h3>
            <p>
                Safe food handling is critical to ensure that surplus food remains healthy and safe for consumption. 
                Our training resources provide guidance to donors and recipients on how to maintain the quality of food throughout the donation process.
            </p>
