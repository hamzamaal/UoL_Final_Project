            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Food Connector is a platform that bridges the gap between food donors and community organizations. 
                We work to eliminate food waste and ensure that surplus food gets to where it's needed most. 
                Through technology, we help streamline the donation process, enabling donors to share resources and 
                recipients to access them seamlessly.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is to fight hunger, reduce food waste, and build stronger, healthier communities. 
                We believe that no food should go to waste when it can make a difference in someoneâ€™s life.
            </p>

            <h2>How We Work</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Donors:</strong> Share surplus food or resources with a few clicks.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Profits:</strong> Receive donations quickly and efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Our platform uses smart matching algorithms to connect donors and recipients in real-time.</li>
            </ul>
