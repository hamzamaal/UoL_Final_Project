        <h3>The Right to Food in South Africa</h3>
        <p>
            South Africa recognizes the <strong>right to food</strong> as a fundamental human right, enshrined in Section 27(1)(b) of the <strong>Constitution of South Africa</strong>. 
            This provision obligates the state to take reasonable measures to ensure everyone has access to sufficient food and water.
        </p>
        <p>
            Food donation plays a critical role in supporting this constitutional right by addressing hunger, reducing food waste, and promoting social justice.
            Organizations and individuals involved in food donation align themselves with the broader goal of advancing food security for vulnerable populations.
        </p>

        <h3>Legal Protection for Donors</h3>
        <p>
            South African law does not have a specific "Good Samaritan Act," but existing frameworks provide protection for donors acting in good faith. Donors are encouraged to comply with food safety regulations and ethical standards to mitigate liability risks. Key protections include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Donation of food that is safe for consumption at the time of transfer</li>
            <li>Adherence to the <strong>Foodstuffs, Cosmetics, and Disinfectants Act</strong> to ensure food safety and proper labeling</li>
            <li>Donation through reputable organizations, such as registered non-profits, to ensure accountability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Food Connector Helps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Connecting donors with vetted non-profits and community organizations</li>
            <li>Providing resources and training to ensure compliance with food safety laws</li>
            <li>Offering transparent reporting mechanisms to track and showcase impact</li>
        </ul>
